Second day in GNDEC , there is our english and maths proficiency test from 9:30am to 11:30 am . We all students give our best in english but in regards to mathematics it seems to be quite difficult because our basics are not so gud and we all have to work on it and also practice it . 
After that there is our break from 11:30 am to 1:00 pm .
Then we reached auditorium at 1:00pm to attend the lectures by expert teachers.
                                                                                      SATYA SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM 2025
Firstly we , all the students came to know about satya schlorship program 2025 which is deeply committed to empowering young minds , especially girl students by giving them an opportunity to pursue higher education.
The trust has launched merit-cum-means scholarship program that fully covers tution fees to support students from diverse socio economic backgrounds who aspire to continue their studies after 12th grade. As per the guidelines given by the teachers and the members of this program many students register with them and become a part of this program which needs them alot to improve their lifestyle and to study better ahead.

 IN THIS LECTURE I UNDERSTAND THAT Food plays a povital and multi- faceted role in a student's overall wellness , impacting their physical health, mental health and academic performance.A balanced and nutritious
 diet is not just about staying physically healthy; it's a foundation for a student's ability to learn , focus and thrive.
 Then there is another session by causmic club and launch of induction activities.
 And with this our second day in GNDEC ends after gaining lots of information from the experts.

 #DAY3
 Third day in college was a quite interesting and very knowledgable because it is a day which started with mul mantar , god's blesssing and with an 
                                                                             Expert lecture by- DR. JASWINDER SINGH
In his lecture he guides us about too many things like to focus on aim , manners and purpose of sitting , why to disturb others in case of any emergency, also that these are not the classrooms these are the training rooms for us in which the teachers shape us , he also motivates us that we can do each and everything , he tells us that science is to know anything and that we all are scientists but to believe in us in our abilities and to be confident. He teaches us to acquire new understanding , knowledge , skills , values attitudes and preferences.
After attending this too fruitful lecture next lecture is by an expert DR. PRIYA DARSHMI MADAM on 
                                                                                       " UNIVERSAL HUMAN VALUES "
In this lecture we came to know about that UHV provides a framework for building strong , loving , and supportive family units . It teaches how to resolve conflicts with understanding and respect , rather than anger and resentment. It would discuss concepts like co- existence and the importance of contributing to the welfare of the community.the lecture also would touch upon the relationship between humans and nature.
Students would be encouraged to introspect, examine their own beliefs and behaviours and indentify where they are lacking in these values.
AT the end of these two lectures our day 3 in GNDEC ends.

#DAY4
Our day in college started and we all students gather in our respective classes as per the schedule.
My first lecture is of chemistry which starts with an inroduction of experienced teacher MANDEEP MAM, started her lecture by telling us about elements, molecules and compound ,difference between physical , organic and inorganic chemistry, uses of chemistry in everyday life and atells us about our syllabus of first chapters which includes 4 chapters only . 
Then as our first lecture ends second lecture started which is of programming language that is C++ . we studied from our seniors about C++ language and note it down because it is a new concept for us all .They tell us through various programs and concepts by which we can easily learn. We also do in our laptops with our seniors side by side so that we all understands it clearly.
After there was a break for an hour and then we gather in the auditorium for next two lectures.
The first lecture was of DR.PRIYA DARSHNI MADAM which was based on "Universal Human Values".In this lecture we all understand many things regarding principles or standards of behaviour that are widely recognized across cultures , religions and societies as essential for human coexistence , dignity and flourishing . While interpretations and expressions of these values may differ, their core significance is generally accepted globally. We learn alot from PRIYA mam regarding right understanding, relationships , about personal behaviour , kindness , tolerance and many other things.
After this amazing lecture there is another session by causmic club .
